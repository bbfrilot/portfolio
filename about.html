    <div class="p1"> 
      At the age of 11, I spent many hours entering lines of pre-existing code into a dinosaur Commodore 64
      computer, and watching basic animations of firework displays or stick people come to life.
      Yes, I am revealing my age. My love for computers was solidified.<br><br>
      </div>
      <div class="p3">
      As computers evolved during the early part of my career, I naturally<br> volunteeered
      to perform any computer work that most people ran away from. Studying software manuals at home<br>(I promise I am not as boring as that sounds)<br>
      I worked with programs like Lotus 1-2-3 WYSIWYG (showing my age again) <br> and AutoCad. When I obtained a
      position in an Engineering Department, <br> I learned about Process Control Systems and how automation
      software<br> controlled them. Bringing home ANOTHER manual, AutoCad took<br> a back seat, and automation
      programs were of my greatest interest.<br><br></div>
    <div class="p4">
      Fast foward many years to the present, with an inspiring and patient teacher, I have continued
      my ever-lasting love of computers, coding my way through the beginning stages of 
      Web Design, and probably breaking every rule of design in this page.....Insert frowning teacher emoji
      here.....
       <br><br></div>
    <div class="p5">A long way from the firework displays and stick people! But,</div>
    <div class="p6">Why NOW? </div> 
    <div class="p7"> I am not 56 YET, but I think 
       <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/yes-im-56-and-learning-to-code-f33abea6fd4c">this blog
        describes why.<a>
